Preparing for a technical interview as a Go (Golang) developer involves understanding the language's core concepts, common libraries, and best practices, as well as demonstrating your problem-solving abilities. Here's an outline of what you should know and practice:

### 1. Core Language Concepts
- **Syntax and Data Types:** Understand basic syntax, data types (int, float, string, bool, etc.), and how to declare variables.
- **Control Structures:** Be familiar with if statements, for loops, switch statements, and how Go handles them.
- **Functions:** Know how to declare and call functions, pass arguments, return values, and understand variadic functions.
- **Structs and Interfaces:** Understand how to define and use structs, methods, and interfaces. Be comfortable with embedding and type assertions.
- **Error Handling:** Grasp Go's approach to error handling using error types and how to create custom errors.
- **Concurrency:** Understand goroutines, channels, and the select statement. Be aware of synchronization mechanisms like sync.Mutex and sync.WaitGroup.

### 2. Standard Library and Common Packages
- **fmt:** For formatted I/O.
- **net/http:** For building web servers and making HTTP requests.
- **io:** For basic input and output interfaces.
- **encoding/json:** For working with JSON data.
- **time:** For dealing with dates and times.
- **os:** For operating system functionality like file I/O.
- **sync:** For concurrency primitives.

### 3. Advanced Topics
- **Go Modules:** Understand module initialization, dependencies, and versioning.
- **Context Package:** Understand context for managing deadlines, cancellations, and passing request-scoped values.
- **Testing:** Know how to write unit tests using the testing package and understand test coverage.
- **Profiling and Performance:** Be aware of tools like pprof for profiling and common performance optimization techniques.
- **Reflection:** Understand the basics of Go's reflect package for runtime type information.

### 4. Practical Skills
- **Build and Deployment:** Know how to build Go applications, cross-compile, and manage build tags.
- **Version Control:** Be comfortable with Git for version control and understand basic workflows.
- **Docker:** Basic understanding of Docker for containerizing Go applications.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Familiarity with setting up continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

### 5. Problem-Solving and Coding Practice
- **Algorithms and Data Structures:** Practice common algorithms (sorting, searching) and data structures (arrays, slices, maps, linked lists, trees).
- **Coding Challenges:** Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars to sharpen your problem-solving skills.
- **System Design:** Be prepared to discuss high-level design of systems, microservices architecture, and designing scalable applications.

### 6. Behavioral and Soft Skills
- **Communication:** Be clear and concise in explaining your thought process and solutions.
- **Collaboration:** Share experiences of working in teams, using version control, and managing code reviews.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** Demonstrate a systematic approach to debugging and solving complex problems.
- **Project Experience:** Be ready to discuss your past projects, your role, and the technologies used.

### 7. Mock Interviews and Practice
- **Mock Interviews:** Participate in mock interviews to get used to the interview format and receive feedback.
- **Technical Questions:** Practice answering common technical questions about Go and general programming concepts.

### Summary
By covering these areas, you'll be well-prepared to demonstrate your proficiency as a Go developer and handle various types of questions and tasks in a technical interview. Remember to balance studying theoretical concepts with hands-on coding practice to reinforce your understanding.
