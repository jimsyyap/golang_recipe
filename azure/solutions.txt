you have sql server on an azure virtual machine. The databases are written to nightly as part of a batch process. You need to recommend a disaster recovery solution for the data. The solution must meet the following requirements:
. Provide the ability to recover in the event of a regional outage
. Support a recovery time objective of 15 minutes
. Support a recovery point objective of 24 hours
. Support automated recovery
. Minimize costs
what should you include in the recommendations?

A - azure sql managed instance with geo-replication and auto-failover groups.

Why azure sql managed instance?
. Managed service: reduces operational overhead, as ms handles patching, backups, and high availability.
. Built-in geo-replication: enables automatic asynchronous data replication to a secondary region, fulfilling the regional outage requirement.
. Auto-failover groups: allows for automatic and seamless failover to the secondary region within minutes, meeting the rto of 15 minutes.

Detailed solution:
1. Migration: migrate your existing sql server database to azure sql managed instance. Unlike the azure database migration service for a seamless transition.
2. Geo-replication: enable geo-replication for your managed instance. Choose a secondary azure region that is geographically distant from your primary region to minimize the impact of regional outages.
3. Auto-failover groups: create an auto-failover group that includes your primary and secondary managed instances. Configure the failover policy to prioritize automatic failover in case of primary region failure.
4. Recovery point objective: the built-in geo-replication provides an rpo close to zero, as transactions are continuously replicated to the secondary region. This easily meets your 24-hour rpo requirement.
5. Automated recovery: the combination of geo-replication and auto-failover groups ensures automated recovery in case of a disaster. The failover process is transparent to your applications, minimizing downtime.
6. Cost optimization: while azure sql managed instance might have a slightly higher base cost than running sql server on a vm, it significantly reduces operational costs due to its managed nature. Additionally, you can leverage reserved instances for further cost savings.

Additional considerations:
. Backup strategy: even with geo-replication and auto-failover, maintain regular backups of your managed instance. This provides an additional layer of protection against data loss due to accidental deletions or corruption.
. Monitoring and alerting: set up robust monitoring and alerting for your managed instance to proactively detect any performance issues or potential failures.

you have an app named appl that uses two on-premise ms sql server db named db1 and db2. You plan to migrate the dbs to azure. You need to recommend a db service for the dbs. The solution must meet the following requirements:
. Support server-side transactions across db1 and db2
. Minimize administrative effort to update the solution. Which db service should you recommend?

A - For migrating on-premise ms sql server db to azure, while meeting the requirements of supporting server-side transactions across both databaseses and minimizing administrative effort, use azure sql managed instance. Here's why:

Key features
1. Ful sql server compatibility
- Azure SQL Managed Instance provides full compatibility with SQL Server, including support for distributed transactions, cross-database queries, and server-side transactions across multiple databases.
2. Minimal administrative effort. Managed instance is a paas offering, which means that azure handles most of the administrative tasks such as backups, patching, and high availability. This significantly reduces the administrative overhead compared to managing a traditional sql server env.
3. High availability and disaster recovery. Built-in high availability with automated backups and point in time restore capabilities. Additionally, you can configure geo-replication for disaster recovery scenarios.
4. Security - advanced security features such as transparent data encryption (tde), advanced threat protection, and azure active directory integration.
5. scaling - easily scale compute and storage resources based on your workload requirements.

Implementation steps
1. Assessment - use the data migration assistant (dma) to assess the compatibility of your on-premise databases with azure sql managed instance and identify any potential issues.

2. Provisioning - create an azure sql managed instance within an azure virtual network (vnet).

3. Migration - use the azure database migration service (dms) to migrate the databases from on-premise sql server to azure sql managed instance. This service supports online and offline migrations and helps ensure minimal downtime during the migration process.

5. Testing - thoroughly test the migrated databases to ensure that all functionalities, including server-side transactions, are working as expected.

6. Go live - once testing is successful, switch over to the azure sql managed instance for production use.

Conclusion
Azure SQL Managed Instance is the recommended database service for migrating on-premise MS SQL Server databases to Azure while supporting server-side transactions across multiple databases and minimizing administrative effort. The service provides full SQL Server compatibility, high availability, security features, and scalability, making it an ideal choice for your migration scenario.

You are designing an applicatin that will be hosted in azure. The app will host video files that range from 50MB to 12GB. The application will use certificate-based authentication and will be available to users on the internet. Recommend a storage opiton for the video files. The solution must provide the fastest read performance and must minimize storage costs.

    For hosting video files in an Azure-based application, the ideal solution considering the requirements of fast read performance and minimized storage costs is Azure Blob Storage with Hot Access Tier. Here’s why:

    Azure Blob Storage with Hot Access Tier

    Azure Blob Storage is designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data such as video files. It is highly scalable and integrates well with Azure services.

    Hot Access Tier is optimized for data that is accessed frequently, which is suitable for your application that hosts video files for internet users.

    Key Benefits

    1. Fast Read Performance:
    - Low Latency: Azure Blob Storage provides low latency for data access, which is critical for video streaming.
    - CDN Integration: Azure Blob Storage can be integrated with Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to further improve the read performance by caching content closer to the users.

    2. Cost Efficiency:
    - Hot Access Tier: While it has higher storage costs compared to the Cool or Archive tiers, it is still optimized for frequently accessed data, providing a good balance between cost and performance.
    - Scalability: You pay only for the storage you use and can scale up or down based on demand, avoiding over-provisioning and associated costs.

    3. Security:
    - Certificate-Based Authentication: Azure Blob Storage supports secure access with Shared Access Signatures (SAS) and can be further secured using Azure Key Vault to manage your certificates and access keys.

    Implementation Steps

    1. Set Up Azure Blob Storage:
    - Create an Azure Storage account via the Azure Portal, CLI, or ARM templates.
    - Configure the account with the Hot Access Tier.

    2. Enable Secure Access:
    - Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration for certificate-based authentication.
    - Manage and rotate your certificates using Azure Key Vault.

    3. Optimize Performance:
    - Enable Azure CDN to cache your video files at edge locations, improving the read performance for users across the globe.
    - Configure blob storage for large file uploads and downloads to optimize throughput.

    Additional Considerations

    - Data Redundancy: Choose the appropriate redundancy option (LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS) based on your durability requirements.
    - Access Patterns: Regularly review access patterns and adjust the storage tier if needed (e.g., move infrequently accessed files to Cool tier).
    - Monitoring and Analytics: Use Azure Monitor and Storage Analytics to track the performance and cost metrics, ensuring your solution remains optimal.

    Conclusion
    By leveraging Azure Blob Storage with Hot Access Tier, you achieve the required fast read performance and cost-effectiveness for hosting large video files. The solution is secure, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, providing a robust platform for your application.
