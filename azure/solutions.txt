# You are designing an applicatin that will be hosted in azure. The app will host video files that range from 50MB to 12GB. The application will use certificate-based authentication and will be available to users on the internet. Recommend a storage opiton for the video files. The solution must provide the fastest read performance and must minimize storage costs.

    For hosting video files in an Azure-based application, the ideal solution considering the requirements of fast read performance and minimized storage costs is Azure Blob Storage with Hot Access Tier. Hereâ€™s why:

    Azure Blob Storage with Hot Access Tier

    Azure Blob Storage is designed for storing large amounts of unstructured data such as video files. It is highly scalable and integrates well with Azure services.

    Hot Access Tier is optimized for data that is accessed frequently, which is suitable for your application that hosts video files for internet users.

    Key Benefits

    1. Fast Read Performance:
    - Low Latency: Azure Blob Storage provides low latency for data access, which is critical for video streaming.
    - CDN Integration: Azure Blob Storage can be integrated with Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to further improve the read performance by caching content closer to the users.

    2. Cost Efficiency:
    - Hot Access Tier: While it has higher storage costs compared to the Cool or Archive tiers, it is still optimized for frequently accessed data, providing a good balance between cost and performance.
    - Scalability: You pay only for the storage you use and can scale up or down based on demand, avoiding over-provisioning and associated costs.

    3. Security:
    - Certificate-Based Authentication: Azure Blob Storage supports secure access with Shared Access Signatures (SAS) and can be further secured using Azure Key Vault to manage your certificates and access keys.

    Implementation Steps

    1. Set Up Azure Blob Storage:
    - Create an Azure Storage account via the Azure Portal, CLI, or ARM templates.
    - Configure the account with the Hot Access Tier.

    2. Enable Secure Access:
    - Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration for certificate-based authentication.
    - Manage and rotate your certificates using Azure Key Vault.

    3. Optimize Performance:
    - Enable Azure CDN to cache your video files at edge locations, improving the read performance for users across the globe.
    - Configure blob storage for large file uploads and downloads to optimize throughput.

    Additional Considerations

    - Data Redundancy: Choose the appropriate redundancy option (LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS) based on your durability requirements.
    - Access Patterns: Regularly review access patterns and adjust the storage tier if needed (e.g., move infrequently accessed files to Cool tier).
    - Monitoring and Analytics: Use Azure Monitor and Storage Analytics to track the performance and cost metrics, ensuring your solution remains optimal.

    Conclusion
    By leveraging Azure Blob Storage with Hot Access Tier, you achieve the required fast read performance and cost-effectiveness for hosting large video files. The solution is secure, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, providing a robust platform for your application.
