**What the Code Does**

Concurrency is incredibly useful for writing programs that do multiple things at once. Imagine a web server handling many user requests or a complex application doing calculations in the background. Go's goroutines and the tools for managing them make it easier to write efficient, responsive software.

1. **Package main:**  This tells Go that this code is the starting point of a standalone program.

2. **Imports:**
    * `fmt`: This package is used for formatting and printing text (like `Println`).
    * `runtime`: This package gives us control over how Go manages multiple tasks running at once.

3. **Functions:**
   * `sayHello()`: This function simply prints "Hello."
   * `main()`: This is the heart of the program where things start.
     * `go sayHello()`: This line is the key! It launches the `sayHello()` function in a separate lightweight thread called a "goroutine." This means "Hello" and "World" can be printed without one having to wait for the other to finish.
     * `runtime.Gosched()`: This line is a hint to the Go runtime that it's a good time to switch to other goroutines if they're waiting to run. In this case, it helps make sure "Hello" gets a chance to print before the `main` function continues.
     * `fmt.Println("World")`: This prints "World."

**The Thought Process: Concurrent Greeting**

The goal of this code is to demonstrate concurrency, a powerful feature of Go. We want to print "Hello" and "World" without having them block each other.  Here's the breakdown of how a programmer might approach this:

1. **The Greeting:** We need a function to print "Hello," which is pretty straightforward.

2. **Concurrency:** Go's `go` keyword is the magic tool for concurrency.  We use it to launch `sayHello()` as a goroutine, allowing it to run independently.

3. **Scheduling:** To make sure "Hello" gets a fair chance to print before "World," we use `runtime.Gosched()`. This isn't strictly necessary in such a simple example, but it's a good practice to help ensure the expected output.

4. **Output:** Finally, the `main()` function prints "World." Since `sayHello()` is running concurrently, we might see "Hello" and "World" print in either order.
