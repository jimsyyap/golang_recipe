**What the Code Does (in a Nutshell)**

This code is like a playful simulation of two people interacting with a shared bank account. Here's what's happening:

* **The stingy person:**  They keep adding small amounts of money to the account (10 units at a time).
* **The spendy person:** They keep withdrawing small amounts of money from the account (10 units at a time).
* **The main program:**  It starts both the stingy and spendy behaviors running simultaneously (like two people acting at the same time), waits for a bit, and then checks the final balance.

**The Thought Process**

Here's how you might approach writing this code:

1. **The Money:**  We need a variable to represent the shared money. Let's call it `money` and give it an initial value (like 1000).

2. **Pointers:** Since we want two functions to modify the same `money` variable, we need to use pointers. A pointer is like a little signpost that tells us where a variable lives in the computer's memory.  So, we'll use `&money` to get the memory address of the `money` variable.

3. **Stingy and Spendy Functions:**
   * `stingy(money *int)`: This function takes a pointer to the `money` variable. It loops a bunch of times and adds 10 to `*money` (the value that the pointer is pointing to) each time.
   * `spendy(money *int)`: This function is almost the same, but it subtracts 10 from `*money` each time.

4. **Concurrent Execution (goroutines):** 
   * The `go` keyword is special in Go. It means "run this function concurrently in a separate goroutine" (think of goroutines like lightweight threads). This is how we make the stingy and spendy actions happen simultaneously.

5. **Pausing (time.Sleep):**
   * We use `time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)` to make the main program pause for 2 seconds. This gives the `stingy` and `spendy` functions a chance to do their thing before we check the final balance. This pause is necessary in this case, because otherwise, the main function would complete and exit before the stingy and spendy goroutines were finished.

6. **The Outcome:**
   * Finally, we print the value of `money`. Since `stingy` and `spendy` were both modifying the same shared variable, the final value will depend on how long the program ran and which function "won" the race.

**Simplified Explanation**

Imagine two kids sharing a piggy bank. One kid keeps putting coins in, and the other kid keeps taking coins out. This code is like that, but instead of coins, it's numbers, and instead of kids, it's computer programs acting simultaneously.

**Important Note:** This code demonstrates concurrency but doesn't have safeguards for race conditions. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to use synchronization mechanisms (like mutexes or channels) to ensure the integrity of shared data when multiple goroutines are accessing and modifying it.
