a company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500GB. Each site has a high-speed internet connection. The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single amazon s3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity. Which cloud solution meets these requirements?

Answer: AWS Snowball Edge
why aws snowball edge: 
. High-speed data transfer - snowball edge is a physical device that can be shipped to each site. It can store up to 80TB of data and has high-speed network interfaces for rapid data transfer over the site's high-speed internet connection.
. On-device processing: snowball edge has compute capabilities, allowing it to preprocess or aggregate data before transferring it to the cloud. This can reduce the amount of data transferred and speed up the overall process.
. Direct integration with s3: snowball edge is designed to work seamlessly with amazon s3, making it easy to transfer the collected data directly into yoru desired s3 bucket.
. Minimal operational complexity - the process of collecting data using snowball edge is relatively simple. You order the device, configure it, ship it to the site, collect the data, and ship it back to aws. Aws handles the data transfer and ingestion into s3.

Other options:
. Direct upload: while possible with high-speed connections, directly uploading 500GB daily from multiple sites could lead to  bandwidth constraints or network congestion, potentially slowing down the process. 
. Aws datasync: this service is useful for ongoing data transfer, but it might not be the most efficient for the initial bulk transfer of large data volumes from multiple locations.
. Aws transfer family - this service is primarily focused on file transfer protocols and might not be the most suitable for the specific requirements of this scenario.

Key advantages of snowball edge:
. Speed - the physical transfer process is often faster than network transfers for large datasets.
. Reliability - snowball edge is designed for secure and reliable data transport.
. Offline capability - it can collect data even if the site temporarily loses internet connectivity.

Overall, aws snowball edge provides a streamlined, efficient, and reliable solution for aggregating large volumes of data from multiple global locations into a single amazon s3 bucket.

A company needs the ability to analye log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in json format in an amazon s3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture. What should the aws solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the least amount of operational overhead?

Answer:
recomment Amazon athena. Here's why:
1. Serverless architecture - athena is a serverless query service, eliminating the need for infrastructure management or setup. This significantly reduces operational overhead.

2. Direct s3 integration - athena can query data directly in amazon s3 without the need for data extraction, transformation or loading (etl) processess. This simplifies the existing architechure and minimizes changes.

3. Json support - athena has built-in support for querying json-formatted data, making it a perfect fit for the company's log files.

4. On-demand queries - athena is designed for ad-hoc queries, meaning you only pay for the queries you run. This aligns with the requirement for running simple on-demand queries.

5. SQL-like interfaces - athena uses a familiar sql-like interface, making it easy for analysts to write and execute queries.

Here's a simplified plan:
1. Create an athena table - define an athena table that points to the s3 bucket containing the log files. Specify the json structure of the log files in the table definition.
2. Start querying - use the athena console or api to write sql queries to analyze the log data. Athena will automatically parse and query the json files in S3.

Additional considerations:
. Cost - while athena is serverless, you will be charged for the amount of data scanned during queries. Consider using partitioning or compression in s3 to optimize costs.
. Performance - if the log files are extremely large or queries become complex, consider using athena's federated query feature to query data in other data sources or use a more specialized log analytics solution like amazon opensearch service.
