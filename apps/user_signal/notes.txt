This Go program is designed to run a specified command with an argument, handle signals (like SIGINT and SIGTERM), and enforce a timeout. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

Breakdown of the Code

1. Imports:
   - The code imports necessary packages for context management, input/output operations, process execution, signal handling, and time functions.

2. createContextWithTimeout Function:
   - Purpose: To create a context with a specified timeout duration.
   - Parameters: `d` (time.Duration for the timeout period).
   - Operation: 
     - Creates a context and a cancel function with a timeout using `context.WithTimeout`.
     - Returns the context and the cancel function.

3. setupSignalHandler Function:
   - Purpose: To handle OS signals and trigger the context cancellation.
   - Parameters: `w` (an `io.Writer` to write messages to), and `cancelFunc` (a context.CancelFunc to cancel the context).
   - Operation:
     - Creates a channel `c` to receive OS signals.
     - Sets up notification for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals using `signal.Notify`.
     - Launches a goroutine that waits for a signal, prints the received signal, and then calls the `cancelFunc` to cancel the context.

4. executeCommand Function:
   - Purpose: To execute a command with an argument within the provided context.
   - Parameters: `ctx` (a `context.Context`), `command` (the command to execute), and `arg` (the argument for the command).
   - Operation: 
     - Uses `exec.CommandContext` to create a command that runs with the given context.
     - Executes the command using `.Run()` and returns any error that occurs.

5. main Function:
   - Purpose: The entry point of the program that sets up the context, signal handler, and runs the command.
   - Operation:
     - Checks if the number of arguments is exactly 3 (program name, command, and argument). If not, it prints usage instructions and exits.
     - Retrieves the command and argument from `os.Args`.
     - Sets a timeout duration of 30 seconds for the command.
     - Creates a context with the specified timeout using `createContextWithTimeout`.
     - Sets up a signal handler using `setupSignalHandler`.
     - Executes the command with the given context and argument using `executeCommand`.
     - If an error occurs during command execution, it prints the error and exits with a non-zero status.

Summary

This Go program:
1. Accepts a command and an argument from the command line.
2. Sets up a context with a 30-second timeout.
3. Installs a signal handler to gracefully handle SIGINT and SIGTERM signals.
4. Executes the specified command with the provided argument, respecting the context's timeout and cancellation.

The program ensures that if the command runs longer than the allowed timeout or if the user sends an interrupt signal, it will terminate the command gracefully.
