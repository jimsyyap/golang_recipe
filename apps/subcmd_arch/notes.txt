--- main.go ---

This Go code is a command-line tool that provides functionality for handling HTTP and gRPC commands. It demonstrates how to manage different subcommands and their respective options, providing usage information when needed. Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of what the code does:

Breakdown of the Code

1. Imports:
   - The code imports necessary packages for error handling, input/output operations, and subcommand handling.

2. Global Variables:
   - `errInvalidSubCommand`: An error message used when an invalid subcommand is provided.

3. printUsage Function:
   - This function prints the usage instructions for the tool, indicating how to use the `http` and `grpc` subcommands. It also calls the help handlers of these subcommands to show their specific options.

4. handleCommand Function:
   - This function handles the logic for determining which subcommand to execute based on the provided arguments.
   - It checks if there are any arguments provided. If not, it sets the error to `errInvalidSubCommand`.
   - It uses a switch statement to handle the different subcommands:
     - `"http"`: Calls the `HandleHttp` function from the `cmd` package.
     - `"grpc"`: Calls the `HandleGrpc` function from the `cmd` package.
     - `"-h"` and `"-help"`: Calls the `printUsage` function to display usage information.
     - Default: Sets the error to `errInvalidSubCommand`.
   - If the error is due to a missing server specification or an invalid subcommand, it prints the error and usage information.
   - Returns the error.

5. main Function:
   - This is the entry point of the program.
   - It calls the `handleCommand` function with the standard output and command-line arguments (excluding the program name).
   - If an error occurs, the program exits with a status code of 1.

Usage

- Command Line Arguments:
  - The tool expects subcommands like `http` or `grpc` followed by their specific options.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    mync http -verb GET http://example.com
    mync grpc -method myMethod -body '{"key":"value"}' http://example.com
    ```

- Help Options:
  - You can get help information by running:
    ```bash
    mync -h
    mync http -h
    mync grpc -h
    ```

Summary

This Go code is a command-line tool framework that handles subcommands for HTTP and gRPC operations. It checks for valid subcommands and their options, provides usage instructions, and executes the appropriate functions from the `cmd` package. The design allows for easy extension to support additional subcommands and options in the future.

---  handle_command_test.go  ---

This Go code is a unit test for the `handleCommand` function. It tests how the function handles different sets of command-line arguments and verifies if the function produces the expected output and errors.

Key Components

1. Imports:
   - `bytes`: For creating a buffer to capture output.
   - `testing`: For writing and running tests.

2. TestHandleCommand Function:
   - This is the main function that contains the test cases for `handleCommand`.
   - It uses the `testing` package to define a test function.

3. Usage Message:
   - A string containing the usage instructions for the `mync` command-line tool, explaining the options and commands available.

4. Test Configurations:
   - A slice of test configurations, each containing:
     - `args`: The command-line arguments to test.
     - `output`: The expected output of the function.
     - `err`: The expected error from the function.

5. Test Execution:
   - The test iterates over each test configuration, calls `handleCommand` with the provided arguments, and checks the result against the expected output and error.

Detailed Walkthrough

1. TestHandleCommand Function:
   - This function sets up the test cases and runs them.

   ```go
   func TestHandleCommand(t *testing.T) {
   ```

2. Usage Message:
   - A string containing usage instructions for the `mync` command-line tool.

   ```go
   usageMessage := `Usage: mync [http|grpc] -h
   ...
   `
   ```

3. Test Configurations:
   - A slice of test configurations with different scenarios to test `handleCommand`.

   ```go
   testConfigs := []struct {
       args   []string
       output string
       err    error
   }{
       {
           args:   []string{},
           err:    errInvalidSubCommand,
           output: "Invalid sub-command specified\n" + usageMessage,
       },
       ...
   }
   ```

4. Test Execution:
   - The test runs each configuration, calls `handleCommand`, and checks if the output and error match the expectations.

   ```go
   byteBuf := new(bytes.Buffer)
   for _, tc := range testConfigs {
       err := handleCommand(byteBuf, tc.args)
       if tc.err == nil && err != nil {
           t.Fatalf("Expected nil error, got %v", err)
       }

       if tc.err != nil && err.Error() != tc.err.Error() {
           t.Fatalf("Expected error %v, got %v", tc.err, err)
       }

       if len(tc.output) != 0 {
           gotOutput := byteBuf.String()
           if tc.output != gotOutput {
               t.Errorf("Expected output to be: %#v, Got: %#v", tc.output, gotOutput)
           }
       }
       byteBuf.Reset()
   }
   ```

Summary

- Purpose: The code is a unit test for the `handleCommand` function. It ensures that `handleCommand` correctly handles various sets of command-line arguments by checking the output and errors against expected values.
- Components:
  - Usage Message: Provides the expected output when `-h` is passed or when an invalid command is specified.
  - Test Configurations: Defines different scenarios to test, including no arguments, help flag, and invalid command.
  - Test Execution: Runs each test case, calls `handleCommand`, and verifies if the output and error are as expected.

This code helps ensure that the `handleCommand` function behaves correctly and provides meaningful error messages and usage instructions when incorrect arguments are passed.
