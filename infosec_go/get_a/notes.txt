Imagine a Phonebook for Websites

Think of the internet as a big city with lots of websites (like houses or shops). Each website has a name (like "[www.example.com](https://www.example.com)") and an address (a special number code that computers use).

This Go code is like someone looking up the address of a specific website ("stacktitan.com") in a special phonebook for websites. Here's how it works:

1. Preparing the Question (var msg dns.Msg):
   - Imagine you have a blank note where you can write down your question. This line of code prepares that note.

2. Writing the Website Name (fqdn := dns.Fqdn("stacktitan.com")):
   - You write the name of the website you're looking for on the note. In this case, it's "stacktitan.com."

3. Asking for the Address (msg.SetQuestion(fqdn, dns.TypeA)):
   - You specify on the note that you want the website's address (not its phone number or other information). This is like saying, "Please tell me the address for stacktitan.com."

4. Calling the Phonebook Operator (dns.Exchange(&msg, "8.8.8.8:53")):
   - You call a special phone operator who knows all the website addresses. In this code, the operator is located at "8.8.8.8:53" (this is a real DNS server run by Google).
   - You give your note to the operator, who then looks up the address and tells you the answer.

In Simple Terms

This code is a very basic way to ask a DNS server (the phonebook operator) for the IP address (the house number) of a specific website. It's a building block for more complex programs that need to find websites on the internet.
