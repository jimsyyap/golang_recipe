This Golang code is about working with file paths and converting strings between different formats: 

Imagine you're in a big library, and you're trying to find a book:

1. The `FullPath` function is like asking the librarian for the exact location of a book. You give it a short name, and it tells you exactly where to find it, including which shelf and section.

2. The `StringToCharPtr` function is like translating the book's title from English to a special computer language that uses numbers.

3. The `StringToUTF16Ptr` function is similar, but it's translating to a different computer language that uses pairs of numbers.

Now, let's break down the thought process for writing this code:

1. For the `FullPath` function:
   - The programmer knows Windows has a special way of writing file paths.
   - They use a Windows function (`GetFullPathName`) to get the full path.
   - They set up a loop to make sure they have enough space to store the whole path.
   - They convert the result back to a normal string that people can read.

2. For `StringToCharPtr`:
   - They know some Windows functions need strings in a special format (null-terminated).
   - They add a zero (null) to the end of the string and return a pointer to it.

3. For `StringToUTF16Ptr`:
   - They know some Windows functions need strings in another special format (UTF-16).
   - They use a built-in Go function to convert the string to this format.
   - They add a null character at the end and return a pointer to it.

The programmer is thinking about how to bridge the gap between how Go handles strings and how Windows expects to receive them. They're creating helper functions that make it easier to work with Windows functions from Go code.

This code is like creating a set of translation tools. It helps Go programs "speak Windows" when they need to, which is important for doing things like working with files or interacting with other parts of the Windows system.
