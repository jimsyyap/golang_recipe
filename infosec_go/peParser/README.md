This Golang code is about looking inside a special type of computer file called a PE (Portable Executable) file. Think of it like peeking inside a toy to see how it's built!

Here's a simple explanation of what the code does, with the thought process on how to write it:

1. Open a file:
   The code starts by opening a file called "Telegram.exe". This is like opening a toy box to look at the toy inside.

2. Read the file structure:
   It then uses a special tool (the "pe" package) to understand the structure of the file. This is like having a map of the toy's parts.

3. Look at different parts:
   The code then looks at different parts of the file, kind of like examining different pieces of the toy:
   - It looks at the "DOS Header", which is like the toy's label.
   - It checks the "Signature Header", which is like a special mark that says this is a PE file.
   - It examines the "COFF File Header", which has information about what kind of toy it is.
   - It looks at the "Optional Header", which has more details about the toy's features.
   - It checks the "Data Directory", which is like a list of special features the toy has.
   - Finally, it looks at the "Section Table", which is like looking at the different main parts of the toy.

4. Print information:
   As it looks at each part, the code prints out information about what it finds. This is like writing down notes about each part of the toy.

The thought process for writing this code might go like this:

1. "I want to look inside a PE file. What tool can I use?" (Answer: the "pe" package in Go)
2. "What parts of a PE file are important to look at?" (Answer: headers, sections, etc.)
3. "How do I read these parts?" (Answer: use functions from the "pe" package and some low-level reading)
4. "How can I present this information clearly?" (Answer: print out labeled information for each part)
