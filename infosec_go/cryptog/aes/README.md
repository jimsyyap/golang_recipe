Imagine you have a secret message and a special lock with two parts: a key and a scramble code. This Golang code is like a tool to use that lock.

**The Thought Process:**

1. **Securing Messages:** We need a way to scramble messages (encryption) and unscramble them back (decryption) using a secret key.
2. **Choosing a Lock:**  The code uses a well-known scrambling method called AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which acts like our lock.
3. **Making it Work Smoothly:**  AES requires messages to be a certain size, so the code adds extra padding before scrambling and removes it after. It's like adding extra paper to fill in empty spaces in your message before locking it in a box.
4. **Keeping it Safe:** The code also uses a random scramble code (initialization vector) along with the key. This adds another layer of security, like having a different combo number each time you use the lock.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

* **`pad` and `unpad` functions:** These handle adding and removing extra padding to the message.
* **`encrypt` function:**
   * Creates random scramble code.
   * Pads the message with extra bytes.
   * Uses the key and scramble code to scramble the message.
* **`decrypt` function:**
   * Checks if the scrambled message is a valid format.
   * Extracts the scramble code from the message.
   * Uses the key and scramble code to unscramble the message.
   * Removes the extra padding added earlier.
* **`main` function:**
   * Generates a random secret key.
   * Defines a sample message.
   * Encrypts the message using the key.
   * Decrypts the scrambled message back to the original message.

**Remember:** In real use, the code would have additional checks and error handling for better security.
