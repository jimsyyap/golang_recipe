Imagine you want to store your secret passwords safely on your computer. This Golang code is like a tool to securely store and check those passwords.

**The Thought Process:**

1. **Problem:** We can't store passwords directly because someone might steal them. 
2. **Solution: Hashing:** The code uses a special process called hashing to turn your password into a scrambled mess (hash) that can't be easily turned back into the original password. It's like turning your secret message into a weird code that only you and the tool understand.
3. **Security:** It's important to make this hash strong, so it takes a long time to crack. The code uses a setting called "cost" to control how strong the hash is.
4. **Checking Passwords:** When you want to log in, you enter your password. The code turns it into a hash again and compares it to the stored hash (like checking your weird code against the original one). If they match, then your password is correct.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

* There's a pre-generated, scrambled password stored in the code (`storedHash`). Imagine this is the secure version of your real password stored on the computer.
* When you run the program, it asks you to type your password.
* The code turns your password into a scrambled hash using a strong setting (`bcrypt.DefaultCost`).
* It compares the newly created hash to the stored one (`storedHash`).
* If the hashes match, it means your password is correct (like your weird code matching the stored one).

**Decisions Made:**

* The code uses a secure hashing algorithm called bcrypt.
* It sets the cost to a default strong level for added security.
* It logs messages to tell you if the password is correct or not.

**Remember:** This is a simplified explanation. In real use, passwords should be stored in a secure database and not directly in the code.
