**Imagine a Neighborhood Map**

Think of your computer network as a neighborhood, with each house having a unique name and address. This Go code is like a friendly mail carrier who walks around the neighborhood and makes a list of all the houses and their addresses.

**What the Code Does**

1. **Finding All the Houses:**
   * The code first looks around the neighborhood to find all the houses (`pcap.FindAllDevs`). It's like the mail carrier checking every street and lane.

2. **Writing Down the Details:**
   * For each house, the code writes down its name (like "The Johnson's House"). This is like the mail carrier writing the names on their clipboard.
   * Then, for each house, the code also writes down its address (like "123 Main Street") and its neighborhood section (like "Block A"). This is like the mail carrier writing the full address on their clipboard.

3. **Sharing the List:**
   * Finally, the code shows you the list of all the houses and their addresses. It's like the mail carrier handing you their clipboard so you can see all the information they gathered.

**Important Words**

* **Package:** Think of this as a toolkit for the code. It contains special tools made by other people for finding houses and addresses in the neighborhood.
* **Import:** This is like taking out the right tools from the toolkit.
* **Functions:** These are like little instructions for the code. "main" is the main set of instructions, telling the code to find the houses and write down their information.

**In Summary:**

This Go code is a way to discover the network interfaces (the "houses") available on your computer and get their IP addresses and netmasks (the "addresses"). It's like having a little map of your computer's network connections.
