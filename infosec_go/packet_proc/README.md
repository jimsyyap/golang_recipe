**Imagine a Secret Clubhouse**

Think of your computer network as a secret clubhouse, with different rooms for different kinds of conversations. This Go code is like a special pair of walkie-talkies that let you listen in on a particular room where kids are talking about secret passwords.

**What the Code Does**

1. **Finding the Right Room:**
   * The code first checks out all the rooms in the clubhouse (`pcap.FindAllDevs`).
   * It looks for a room with the special code name "enp0s5" (`iface`). This is like finding a room with a secret knock.
   * If it can't find the room, it gets upset and throws a fit (`log.Panicf`).

2. **Eavesdropping:**
   * Once the code finds the right room, it turns on the walkie-talkies (`pcap.OpenLive`) and starts listening.
   * It also sets a special filter to only hear the parts of the conversation where kids whisper "USER" or "PASS" â€“ their secret password words (`filter = "tcp and dst port 21"`).

3. **Spilling the Secrets:**
   * Whenever the code hears someone say "USER" or "PASS", it shouts out what they said for everyone to hear (`fmt.Print(string(payload))`). It's like a little tattletale!

**Important Words**

* **Package:** Think of this as a big box of spy tools the code can use. It contains special tools made by other people for eavesdropping on clubhouse conversations.
* **Import:** This is like taking the right tools out of the spy box.
* **Variables:** These are like labels for important things in the code. "iface" is the label for the room's code name, and "filter" is the label for the special filter on the walkie-talkies.
* **Functions:** These are like little instructions the code follows. "main" is the main set of instructions, telling the code to find the room and start listening for passwords.

**In Summary:**

This Go code is a way to listen to a specific kind of conversation (FTP protocol) happening on your computer network (the "clubhouse"). In this case, it is programmed to specifically listen for the words "USER" or "PASS" being exchanged (likely usernames and passwords). Be aware that using such code without authorization is illegal and unethical.
