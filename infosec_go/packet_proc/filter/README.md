**Imagine a Playground**

Imagine a playground where lots of kids are talking to each other. This Go code is like a special pair of headphones that let you listen in on a specific conversation happening on the playground.

**What the Code Does**

1. **Finding the Right Conversation:**
   * The code first looks around the playground to find all the conversations happening (`pcap.FindAllDevs`).
   * It then specifically searches for a conversation that uses a special code word "enp0s5" (`iface`). This is like finding a conversation happening on a specific swing set.
   * If it can't find that conversation, it throws a tantrum (`log.Panicf`).

2. **Listening in:**
   * Once the conversation is found, the code puts on the special headphones (`pcap.OpenLive`) and starts listening.
   * It even puts a filter on the headphones to only hear the parts of the conversation where the kids are talking about their favorite snacks (`filter = "tcp and port 80"`). This is like only listening when someone says "cookies" or "ice cream."

3. **Sharing What's Heard:**
   * Whenever the code hears something interesting in the conversation, it shouts it out for everyone to hear (`fmt.Println(packet)`). 

**Important Words**

* **Package:** This is like a box of tools for the code to use. It contains special tools made by other people for listening to playground conversations.
* **Import:** This is like grabbing the right tools from the toolbox.
* **Variables:** These are like labels for important things in the code.  "iface" is the label for the code word the conversation uses, and "filter" is the label for the special filter on the headphones.
* **Functions:** These are like little instructions the code follows. "main" is the main set of instructions, and it tells the code to find the conversation and start listening.

**In Summary:**

This Go code is a way to listen to a specific kind of conversation happening on your computer network (the "playground"). It's useful if you want to know what information your computer is sending and receiving over the internet.
