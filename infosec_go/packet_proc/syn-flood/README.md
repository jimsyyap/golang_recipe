**Imagine a Treasure Hunt**

Imagine a big treasure hunt in a busy park. This Go code is like a special pair of binoculars that helps you find clues by looking for certain flags or signals from other treasure hunters.

**What the Code Does**

1. **Setting Up the Binoculars:**
   * The code gets ready to use the special binoculars (`pcap.OpenLive`). 
   * It sets the binoculars to a specific mode to look for specific flags or signals (`handle.SetBPFFilter`). Think of it like adjusting the focus on the binoculars to only see flags of a certain color.

2. **Scanning the Park:**
   * The code starts scanning the park with the binoculars (`gopacket.NewPacketSource`). It's like looking all around for any sign of the special flags.

3. **Identifying Clues:**
   * Every time the binoculars spot a flag or signal, the code checks to see if it's a clue (`networkLayer`, `transportLayer`). This is like looking for a specific pattern or symbol on the flag.
   * If the flag isn't a clue, the code ignores it and keeps looking.

4. **Keeping Track of Clues:**
   * When the code finds a real clue, it writes it down in a notebook (`results[srcPort] += 1`). This is like making a tally mark next to the name of the person who sent the clue.

**Important Words**

* **Package:** Think of this as a backpack full of tools for the code to use. It contains special tools made by other people for finding clues in the park.
* **Import:** This is like taking out the right tools from the backpack.
* **Variables:** These are like labels for important things in the code. "filter" is the label for the special flag the code is looking for.
* **Functions:** These are like little instructions the code follows. "capture" is the main set of instructions, telling the code how to use the binoculars to find clues.

**In Summary:**

This Go code is a way to listen to conversations (network traffic) happening on your computer (the "park") and look for specific messages (the "flags") that are part of a specific type of communication (TCP). It can be used to troubleshoot network issues or analyze traffic patterns.
