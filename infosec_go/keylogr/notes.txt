Imagine a Chat Room

This code is like creating a special chat room where you can send and receive secret messages. Here's how it works:

1. Setting Up the Room (init):
   Imagine you need a special address to find the chat room and a special code word to enter. The code sets those up.
   It also prepares a secret message template that will help you understand the messages you receive.

2. Entering the Room (serveWS):
   When someone wants to join, the code checks if they have the right code word.
   If they do, it welcomes them into the room.
   The code keeps listening for any messages they send.

3. Reading Secret Messages:
   Whenever someone in the room sends a message, the code reads it.
   Then, it tells everyone else in the room who sent the message and what it says.

4. The Secret Message Decoder (serveFile):
   This part of the code gives everyone a special decoder tool.
   This tool helps them understand the secret messages they receive in the chat room.

5. Opening the Room (main):
   The code opens the chat room at a special address on the internet (like a website).
   It waits for people to join and starts the secret message exchange.

In simpler words, this code:

* Creates a chat room for secret messages.
* Makes sure only people with the right code word can enter.
* Lets people send and receive messages in the room.
* Gives everyone a tool to decode the secret messages.
