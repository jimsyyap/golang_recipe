# What this code does:

This program connects to a server, sends a command (which it gets from the command line), and then prints out the result of that command.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Setting up:
   - We import necessary packages, including one for gRPC (a way for computers to talk to each other).
   - We define the `main` function, where our program starts.

2. Connecting to the server:
   - We set up options for connecting.
   - We use these options to connect to a server running on the same computer (localhost) at port 9090.
   - If we can't connect, we stop the program with an error message.

3. Preparing the command:
   - We create a new `Command` object.
   - We set the `In` field of this object to be the first argument given when running the program.

4. Sending the command and getting the result:
   - We use the `RunCommand` function to send our command to the server.
   - We wait for the server to send back the result.

5. Showing the result:
   - If there was an error, we stop the program and show the error.
   - If everything worked, we print out the result (which is in the `Out` field of the command).

## The thought process for writing this kind of code might go like this:

1. "I need to make a program that can send a command to a server and get the result back."
2. "gRPC seems like a good way to communicate with the server."
3. "First, I'll need to connect to the server."
4. "Then, I'll need to take the command from the command line arguments."
5. "I'll send this command to the server using the RunCommand function."
6. "Finally, I'll print out whatever result the server sends back."

This program is creating a simple client for a remote command execution server. It's designed to work with the server program you showed me earlier. Together, they form a system where this client can send commands to be executed on the machine running the server.

It's important to note that such tools should only be used in environments where you have explicit permission, as they can potentially be used for unauthorized access if misused.
