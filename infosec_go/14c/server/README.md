# Simple Explanation of the Golang Code

This code sets up a gRPC server system with two types of servers: an implant server and an admin server. It's designed for remote command execution, where an admin can send commands to implants (which could be other computers or devices).

The thought process for writing this kind of code typically involves:

1. Identifying the need for a client-server architecture
2. Choosing gRPC as the communication protocol
3. Defining the server types and their roles
4. Implementing the necessary gRPC methods
5. Setting up channels for inter-server communication
6. Creating the main function to tie everything together


## Explanation of golang gRPC Server Code
This code is creating a system where two different types of users (admins and implants) can talk to each other using a special kind of phone line (gRPC). 

## Main Parts:

1. **Two types of servers:** 
   - Implant Server: Like a worker waiting for tasks
   - Admin Server: Like a boss giving out tasks

2. **Channels:** 
   - Think of these as mailboxes where tasks and results are put

3. **gRPC:** 
   - A way for computers to talk to each other, like a special telephone

## How it works:

1. The admin sends a command (like "clean the room")
2. The implant picks up the command and does it
3. The implant sends back the result (like "room is clean now")
4. The admin gets the result

## Thought Process for Writing This:

1. **Plan the structure:**
   - Decide we need two types of servers (admin and implant)
   - Figure out how they'll communicate (using gRPC)

2. **Set up the basics:**
   - Import necessary libraries
   - Define the main structures for our servers

3. **Create the communication channels:**
   - Make channels for work and output

4. **Write the server functions:**
   - FetchCommand: How the implant gets work
   - SendOutput: How the implant reports results
   - RunCommand: How the admin gives commands

5. **Set up the main function:**
   - Create listeners for both servers
   - Start both servers

6. **Handle errors:**
   - Make sure to catch and report any problems

7. **Test and refine:**
   - Run the code, fix any bugs, and improve as needed

This code creates a flexible system where admins can give commands to implants, which could be useful for managing many computers or devices from one central place.
