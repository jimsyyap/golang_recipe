# what it's about...

1. First, we're creating a program that acts like a remote control for a computer. It's designed to receive commands from somewhere else and run them on this computer.

2. The program uses something called gRPC, which is a way for computers to talk to each other over the internet. It's like a special phone line between computers.

3. Here's the basic idea of how it works:
   - The program connects to another computer (the "server") that will send it commands.
   - It keeps asking the server, "Do you have any commands for me?"
   - If it gets a command, it runs it and sends back the result.
   - If there's no command, it waits for a bit and asks again.

Now, let's go through the thought process of writing this code:

1. We start by importing the necessary packages. We need things for running commands, handling text, and using gRPC.

2. In the main function, we set up the connection to the server:
   - We create some options for the connection, like saying it's okay if it's not super secure.
   - We try to connect to "localhost" on port 4444. This means the server is on the same computer for testing purposes.
   - If we can't connect, we stop the program with an error.

3. Once connected, we create a "client" that can talk to the server using gRPC.

4. We then start an infinite loop. This is the heart of our program:
   - We ask the server for a command using `FetchCommand`.
   - If we get an empty command, we wait for 3 seconds and try again.
   - If we get a real command, we split it into parts (like "ls -l" becomes ["ls", "-l"]).
   - We use these parts to create a system command that we can run.
   - We run the command and collect its output.
   - If there's an error running the command, we capture that too.
   - We send the output (or error message) back to the server using `SendOutput`.

5. This loop keeps going forever, always ready to receive and execute new commands.

The tricky parts when writing this kind of code are:
- Setting up gRPC correctly, which can be complex.
- Handling commands safely, as running commands from the internet can be dangerous.
- Dealing with errors at every step, because lots of things can go wrong.
- Making sure the program keeps running even if there are temporary problems.

This code is actually quite powerful and potentially dangerous - it essentially allows someone to control this computer remotely. In a real-world scenario, you'd want to add a lot more security measures.
