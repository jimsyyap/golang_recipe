Imagine a detective trying to unlock a treasure chest.

1. The Treasure Chest and Key:
    - The treasure chest is a computer system the detective wants to access.
    - The key is a username and password combination.

2. Gathering Clues:
    - The detective has a list of possible usernames in a notebook (`os.Args[1]`).
    - They also know a password they want to try (`os.Args[2]`), the name of the castle where the treasure chest is located (`os.Args[3]`), and the specific room number (`os.Args[4]`).

3. Testing the Keys:
    - The detective goes through each username in the notebook.
    - For each username, they try the password and see if it unlocks the treasure chest.
    - They use a special tool called "smb" to do this. It's like a lockpick for computer systems.

4. Success or Failure:
    - If the username and password combination works, the detective shouts, "Success!" and writes down the correct combination in their notebook.
    - If the combination doesn't work, the detective tries the next username on the list.

In Simple Words:

This code tries to guess the correct username and password to access a computer system. It reads a list of usernames from a file, tries each one with a given password, and prints out the successful combinations. 

Key Points:

* SMB: A way computers share files and printers.
* Authentication: Checking if a username and password are correct.
* Brute-force attack: Trying many combinations to find the right one (not the best way, but that's what this code does).
