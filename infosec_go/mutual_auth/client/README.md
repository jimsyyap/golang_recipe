**The Story:**

Imagine you want to send a secret message to your friend across the street. You don't want anyone else to read it, so you use a special code language. This code makes sure the message is scrambled until it gets to your friend. They have the key to unscramble it.  This Go code is kind of like that, but instead of you and your friend, it's a computer talking to a website.

**What the Code Does (ELI5):**

1. **Getting Ready:** The code starts by saying it needs special tools from a "toolbox" to make the code work. It imports things like `crypto/tls` (for our code language) and `net/http` (for talking to websites).

2. **Loading Secret Keys:** Next, it grabs your secret codebook (`cert.pem`) and the special key (`key.pem`) to lock and unlock messages. These files make sure only you and the website can understand each other. It also loads the website's codebook (`server.crt`) so you can trust it's really them you're talking to.

3. **Creating a Trust Circle:** The code creates a group of trusted people. It adds the website to this group because you trust their codebook.  This means you'll only accept messages from them if they use their special key.

4. **Speaking the Code Language:** Now, the code sets up a way to talk in this secret code language. It uses the special tools and your secret keys to make sure every message you send and receive is protected.

5. **Sending a Message:** Finally, the code goes to a specific website ("https://localhost:8080"). It sends a request and, since it's speaking the right secret code, the website sends back a response. The code reads and prints that response.

**Why Each Step is Important:**

* **Secret Keys:** These are like the unique lock and key you have for your house. They keep things safe.
* **Trust Circle:** It's like only talking to people you know and trust in a crowded room.
* **Code Language:** This makes sure no one else can understand what you're saying.
* **The Website Visit:** This is the reason for all the preparation â€“ to have a secure conversation.

**How to Write It (Thought Process):**

1. **Import Tools:** Figure out what special "tools" you need from the Go language.
2. **Load Secrets:** Make sure you have the right files for the codebooks and keys.
3. **Establish Trust:** Set up who you trust to talk to.
4. **Set Up Communication:** Tell the code how to use the secret language.
5. **Send and Receive:**  Actually go to the website and get the response.
