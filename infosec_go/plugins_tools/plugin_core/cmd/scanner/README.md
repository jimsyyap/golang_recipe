**What the Code Does (The Simple Explanation)**

Imagine you have a collection of tools (`PluginsDir`) designed to check if websites have security weaknesses. This Go code is like a master craftsman who goes through each tool, one by one, and uses it to examine a specific website. If a tool finds a problem, it reports back to the craftsman.

**The Thought Process (How to Write It)**

1. **The Goal:** We want to create a system where we can easily add new tools for checking website vulnerabilities without changing the main program.

2. **Plugins:** We decide to use the concept of "plugins." Each tool will be a separate plugin that our main program can load and use. This makes it super easy to add or remove tools as needed.

3. **Go's Plugin System:** We discover that Go has a built-in plugin system (`plugin`) that makes it simple to load code from external files at runtime.

4. **Standard Interface:** We realize that our tools (plugins) need to follow a standard format so that the main program knows how to use them. We create an interface (`scanner.Checker`) that each plugin must implement. This interface defines a `Check` method that the main program will call to do the vulnerability checking.

5. **The Plan:**
   - Read all the plugin files from the `PluginsDir`.
   - For each plugin file:
     - Load the plugin using `plugin.Open`.
     - Find the special `New` function in the plugin that creates a new instance of the tool.
     - Use the tool to check the website (`check.Check("10.0.1.20", 8080")`).
     - Report the result ("Host is vulnerable" or "Host is NOT vulnerable").

**Code Breakdown (A Closer Look)**

- **Constants:**
  - `PluginsDir`: The directory where the plugin files are located.

- **Variables:**
  - `files`: A list of the plugin files we find.
  - `err`: Used to catch errors during file operations and plugin loading.
  - `p`: Represents the loaded plugin.
  - `n`: Used to look up the `New` function inside the plugin.
  - `check`: Holds an instance of the tool created by the `New` function.
  - `res`: Holds the result of the vulnerability check.

- **Reading Plugin Files:** The code uses `ioutil.ReadDir` (deprecated, should be `os.ReadDir`) to get a list of files in the `PluginsDir`.

- **Loading and Using Plugins:**
  - For each file, `plugin.Open` loads the plugin.
  - `p.Lookup("New")` finds the `New` function.
  - `newFunc, ok := n.(func() scanner.Checker)` checks if the `New` function has the correct signature (returns a `scanner.Checker`).
  - `check = newFunc()` creates a new instance of the tool.
  - `res = check.Check("10.0.1.20", 8080")` calls the tool's `Check` method to examine the website.
  - The result (`res.Vulnerable`) is checked and a message is printed accordingly.

**Important Note:** The code uses `ioutil.ReadDir`, which is deprecated. Use `os.ReadDir` instead:
```
  if files, err = os.ReadDir(PluginsDir); err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err)
	}
```
