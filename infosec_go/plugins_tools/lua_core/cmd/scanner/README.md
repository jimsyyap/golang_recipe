**What the Code Does (The Simple Explanation)**

Imagine you have a toolbox (`PluginsDir`) filled with scripts (Lua files) that help you test websites.  This Go code is a way to run those scripts, giving them special abilities to interact with websites.

**The Thought Process (How to Write It)**

1. **The Goal:** We want to be able to run Lua scripts that can easily interact with websites (send requests, check responses).

2. **Lua:** We choose Lua as our scripting language because it's known for being lightweight and easy to embed within other applications (like our Go program).

3. **Go and Lua:** We find a library called "gopher-lua" that lets us smoothly combine Go and Lua code.

4. **Custom Functions:**  We realize our scripts will need specific actions for testing websites, like making "HEAD" requests (to check if a page exists) and "GET" requests (to fetch page content). We decide to create custom functions in Go (`head` and `get`) that our Lua scripts can use.

5. **Bridging the Gap:** We use the "gopher-lua" library to register our custom functions so that Lua scripts can call them as if they were built-in commands.

6. **The Plan:**
   - Read all the Lua scripts from the `PluginsDir`.
   - For each script:
     - Run the script using the Lua interpreter.
     - The script can now call our custom `http.head` and `http.get` functions.

**Code Breakdown (A Closer Look)**

- **Constants:**
  - `LuaHttpTypeName`:  A name we give to our custom "http" object in Lua.
  - `PluginsDir`: The location of our Lua scripts.

- **`register` Function:**
  - Creates a special "http" object in Lua.
  - Makes our custom `head` and `get` functions available as methods on that object (e.g., `http.head()`, `http.get()`).

- **`head` and `get` Functions:**
  - These are Go functions that handle the details of making HTTP requests (using Go's `net/http` library).
  - They take input from the Lua script (host, port, path, etc.).
  - They return values back to the Lua script (status code, whether authentication is needed, error messages).

- **`main` Function:**
  - Sets up the Lua interpreter.
  - Registers our custom functions.
  - Reads all the files in the `PluginsDir`.
  - For each file:
    - Prints the filename for our information.
    - Executes the Lua script.  If there's an error, it stops the program and logs the error.

**Example Lua Script (How to Use It)**

```lua
local status, authRequired, err = http.head("example.com", 80, "/")
if status == 200 then
  print("Website is up!")
else
  print("Something's wrong:", err)
end
```
**Important Note:** The code uses `ioutil.ReadDir`, which is deprecated. Use `os.ReadDir` instead:
```
  if files, err = os.ReadDir(PluginsDir); err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err)
	}
```
