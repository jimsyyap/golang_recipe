**The Big Idea: Secret Messages**

Imagine you and your friends have a super-secret way of sending messages that nobody else can understand. This code does something similar, but with computers.

**The Tools: Boxes, Keys, and Scrambling**

* **Boxes (Cipher):**  Think of these like special boxes that lock up your message. Only someone with the right key can open them. The "AES" cipher is a type of box that's really good at keeping secrets.
* **Keys:** Just like a house key, this is a special code that unlocks the box. In this code, the key is a bunch of random numbers (32 of them).
* **Scrambling (Encryption):**  This is like putting your message in the box, locking it with the key, and then shaking the box so hard that the message gets all jumbled up.
* **Unscrambling (Decryption):** This is using the key to unlock the box and put the jumbled message back in the right order.

**How the Code Works (Like a Recipe)**

1. **Making the Key:** The code makes a random key (like pulling numbers out of a hat).
2. **Encrypt (Lock and Scramble):**
   * It gets the special box (AES cipher) ready.
   * It makes an extra lock for the box (GCM) that's even trickier.
   * It puts your message in the box, locks it with both locks, and scrambles it all up.
   * It sticks the extra lock's information at the beginning of the scrambled message, so the person who wants to open it knows how to start.
3. **Decrypt (Unlock and Unscramble):**
   * It gets the same kind of box and extra lock ready.
   * It looks at the scrambled message, finds the extra lock's info, and figures out how to open it.
   * It unlocks the extra lock, then the main box lock, and then puts the message back into the right order.
4. **The Test:**
    * The code tests itself by encrypting a message ("Hello, World!") and then decrypting it to make sure it got the message back correctly.

**Why Think This Way?**

This way of thinking about encryption is helpful because:

* **It's Easier to Understand:**  Complex ideas become simple with familiar analogies.
* **It Shows the Steps:** You can see the process clearly: making the key, locking/scrambling, unlocking/unscrambling.
* **It Highlights Security:** It shows the importance of the key and how it's used to keep the message safe.

**Important Note:** In real-world scenarios, you wouldn't hardcode the key like this; it would be stored securely or generated on the fly. This is just to illustrate the encryption process.
