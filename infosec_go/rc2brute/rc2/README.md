**What This Code Does**

This code implements the RC2 block cipher in Golang. RC2 is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm designed for fast software implementation. Here's the basic idea:

1. **Block Cipher:** RC2 operates on blocks of data (8 bytes in this case). It takes a block of plaintext and a secret key as input and produces a block of ciphertext as output.
2. **Key Expansion:** The provided secret key is expanded into a larger internal key schedule (`k`). This expanded key is used in multiple rounds of encryption/decryption.
3. **Encryption/Decryption Rounds:** The core of RC2 is a series of rounds that mix the data and the expanded key. These rounds involve bitwise operations, additions, and rotations.
4. **PiTable:** This is a fixed table of values used to substitute bytes during key expansion. It's part of the algorithm's design.

**Thought Process: How to Write RC2 in Go**

1. **Understand the Algorithm:** The first step is to thoroughly understand how the RC2 algorithm works. This includes the key expansion process, the encryption/decryption steps, and the role of the PiTable. You can find detailed specifications online.

2. **Structure the Code:**
   * **rc2Cipher struct:** This struct holds the expanded key (`k`).
   * **New() function:** This function takes the user's secret key and expands it into the `k` array. It also initializes an `rc2Cipher` instance.
   * **BlockSize() method:** This method returns the block size (8 bytes).
   * **Encrypt() and Decrypt() methods:** These are the core functions that perform the actual encryption and decryption, respectively.

3. **Key Expansion (expandKey function):**
   * Copy the user's key into a larger byte array (`l`).
   * Extend the key based on the input key's length and a mixing parameter (`t1`).
   * Apply substitutions using the `piTable` to generate the expanded key `k`.

4. **Encryption/Decryption Rounds:**
   * Extract 16-bit words (r0, r1, r2, r3) from the input block.
   * Perform multiple rounds of mixing using the expanded key `k`. Each round involves:
      * Bitwise AND, XOR, and addition operations.
      * Rotations of the 16-bit words.
   * The decryption process is essentially the reverse of encryption, using the same expanded key in a different order.

**Simplified Explanation (ELI5)**

Imagine you have a secret message you want to scramble so that only someone with the right key can read it.

1. You and your friend agree on a secret code (the key).
2. You take this code and create a longer, more complex code (expanded key) to use for scrambling.
3. You cut your message into chunks (blocks).
4. For each block, you mix it with a piece of the expanded code, doing some math and shuffling steps.  You repeat this several times (rounds).
5. The result is a jumbled mess (ciphertext) that only someone with the original secret code can unscramble.

**Important Note:** RC2 is considered insecure by today's standards due to vulnerabilities and attacks that have been discovered over time. It's not recommended for use in new applications where strong security is required.
