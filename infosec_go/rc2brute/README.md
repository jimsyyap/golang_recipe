**What This Code Does**

This code is designed to crack a ciphertext that was encrypted using the RC2 algorithm. It uses a technique called brute-force, where it tries every possible key within a certain range until it finds the correct one. Here's the core functionality:

1. **Target:** The code is looking for a valid credit card number. It assumes the original plaintext is a 16-digit number that passes the Luhn algorithm check (a common credit card validation method).
2. **Key Generation:** It systematically generates possible keys within a specified range. Each key is 8 bytes (64 bits) long.
3. **Decryption:** Each generated key is used to decrypt the ciphertext. The result is checked to see if it matches the pattern of a valid credit card number.
4. **Parallel Processing:** To speed things up, the code uses goroutines (lightweight threads) to perform key generation and decryption in parallel.
5. **Early Termination:** Once a valid credit card number is found, the program stops and reports the decrypted plaintext and the key used to decrypt it.

**Thought Process: How to Write This Code**

1. **Goal:** Your objective is to recover a credit card number from encrypted data. You know the encryption algorithm (RC2) but not the key.

2. **Brute-Force Approach:** Since you don't have any hints about the key, brute-force is a logical choice. You'll try all possible keys systematically.

3. **Key Space:** Decide on a reasonable range for the keys you'll test. In this case, the code uses the full range of 64-bit values.

4. **Parallelism:** To make the brute-force process faster, use goroutines to split the work. You can have multiple goroutines generating keys and others decrypting with those keys.

5. **Data Structures:**
   - `CryptoData`: A struct to hold a decrypted block of data and the corresponding key used for decryption.
   - Channels (`work`, `done`): Channels are used to communicate between goroutines. The `work` channel sends `CryptoData` objects from key generators to decryptors. The `done` channel signals when a valid key is found.

6. **Functions:**
   - `generate`: This function produces keys within a given range and sends them on the `work` channel.
   - `decrypt`: This function receives keys from the `work` channel, decrypts the ciphertext, and checks if the result is a valid credit card.

7. **Main Function:**
   - Set up the ciphertext you want to decrypt.
   - Initialize goroutines for key generation and decryption.
   - Wait for the brute-force process to finish.
   - Close channels and clean up.

**Simplified Explanation (ELI5)**

Imagine you have a locked treasure chest (ciphertext). You know the type of lock (RC2), but you don't have the key. Here's what the code does:

1. **Helpers:** You have friends (goroutines) who can help you.
2. **Trying Keys:** Your friends start trying every possible key combination (brute-force). They pass each key to you.
3. **Checking:** You try each key to unlock the chest. If it opens, you check if the treasure inside is a real credit card (Luhn check).
4. **Success:** If you find a key that works and reveals a valid credit card, you shout "Eureka!" and everyone stops.

**Important Notes:**

- **Insecurity of RC2:** RC2 is now considered insecure for serious use due to vulnerabilities.
- **Realistic Scenario:** This is a simplified example. Real-world ciphertext cracking often involves more complex algorithms and requires significant computing power.
