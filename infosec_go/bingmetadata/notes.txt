How It Works
Command-Line Arguments:

The program expects two arguments: a domain and a file extension (e.g., example.com pdf).
Building the Search Query:

Constructs a Bing search query to find files of the specified type within the specified domain.
Example query: site:example.com && filetype:pdf && instreamset:(url title):pdf.
Making the HTTP Request:

Sends an HTTP GET request to Bing with the constructed query.
Parsing the Search Results:

Parses the HTML response from Bing using goquery to find search results.
Downloading and Processing Each File:

For each search result, the handler function is called.
The handler downloads the file, reads it as a zip archive, and extracts metadata using the metadata package.
Extracting Metadata:

Extracts metadata like creator, last modified by, application, and major version from the downloaded file and logs this information.
