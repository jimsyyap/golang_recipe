**What the Code Does (The Simple Explanation)**

Imagine you have a website with a login form. This Go code is like a detective who's trying to see if that login form has a specific weakness called SQL Injection.  SQL Injection is a way hackers can try to trick your website into revealing secret information from its database. This code tries to "poke" at the login form with different inputs to see if it reacts in a way that suggests it might be vulnerable.

**The Thought Process (How to Write It)**

1. **The Goal:** We want to find out if a website is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

2. **How SQL Injection Works:**  We learn that SQL Injection happens when a website doesn't properly check the data entered into a form, and that this can sometimes lead to error messages that reveal clues about the website's database.

3. **The Plan:**
   - We'll send different unusual inputs (our "payloads") to the login form.
   - We'll look for specific words or patterns (our "sqlErrors") in the website's responses that might suggest a vulnerability.
   - If we find those patterns, we'll report it as a potential problem.

4. **Tools:**  We'll use Go's:
   - `net/http` library to send data to the website and get its response.
   - `regexp` library to search for patterns in the website's response.
   - `fmt` library to format our output nicely.

5. **Writing the Code:**
   - We create two lists:
      - `payloads`: a list of the unusual inputs we'll try.
      - `sqlErrors`: a list of words/patterns we'll search for in the responses.
   - We convert the `sqlErrors` into tools that help us search quickly (`errRegexes`).
   - We loop through each `payload`:
     - Send the `payload` to the login form.
     - Get the website's response.
     - Search for the `sqlErrors` in the response.
     - If we find a match, print a message saying we found a potential SQL error.

**Code Breakdown (A Closer Look)**

- **Payloads:**  These are the unusual inputs we send to the login form. They include things like extra parentheses and quotation marks that might confuse the website if it's not careful.
- **SQL Errors:** These are words like "SQL," "MySQL," and "ORA-" that are often found in database error messages.
- **Regular Expressions (`errRegexes`):** These are special patterns we use to quickly search for the `sqlErrors` in the website's responses.
- **The Loop:** This is where the main action happens.  We send each `payload`, get the response, and check for `sqlErrors`.
- **Output:** If we find a match, we print a message saying what we found and with which `payload`.

**Important Note:** This code is a simplified example.  Real-world security testing is more complex and involves a wider range of tests and safeguards.
