What's the Big Idea?

This code is designed to figure out the geographic location (like the country and continent) of IP addresses. It uses a special database called MaxMind GeoIP database that contains information linking IP addresses to locations.

How Does It Work?

1. Setup:
   - It starts by importing some necessary tools from other libraries.
   - It then opens the MaxMind database file (`GeoLite2-City.mmdb`). This database is like a big dictionary where you can look up an IP address and find out where it's likely from.
   - It defines a special structure (`GeoCityRecord`) to hold the information about the location it will find.

2. IP Address Range:
   - It takes an IP address range ("2.0.0.0/8") and figures out all the smaller networks within that range.

3. Looking Up Locations:
   - It goes through each network in the range.
   - For each network, it finds the corresponding record in the database. This record contains details like the latitude, longitude, country code, and continent code.

4. Extracting and Displaying Information:
   - It converts the record into a format that's easier to work with (JSON).
   - It then extracts the specific pieces of information we're interested in:
     - The IP address itself
     - The longitude and latitude
     - The country code (like "US" for the United States)
     - The continent code (like "NA" for North America)
   - Finally, it prints out this information in a neat format.

Example Output

Imagine the code finds an IP address "2.10.20.30."  The output might look something like this:

```
IP : 2.10.20.30, Long : -122.4194, Lat : 37.7749, Country : US, Continent: NA
```

This tells us the IP address is likely located in the United States (US) in North America (NA).

Is That All?

There are a few more technical details (like error handling and data conversion), but this explanation captures the core idea of the code.
