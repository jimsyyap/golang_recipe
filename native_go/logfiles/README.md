This program is like a diary writer. It creates a special notebook (a log file) in a secret place on the computer. Then it writes some messages in this notebook, like "Hello there!" and "what you did". It's a way for the computer to remember what it did, just like you might write in a diary about your day.

Now, let's go through the thought process of writing this code:

1. We want to create a program that writes messages to a log file.

2. First, we need to decide where to put this log file. We choose the computer's temporary directory because it's a good place for files that aren't permanent.

3. We need to create a name for our log file. We decide on "mGo.log".

4. We want to open this file so we can write to it. If the file doesn't exist, we want to create it. If it does exist, we want to add to it, not overwrite it.

5. We should check if there's any problem opening the file. If there is, we want to tell the user and stop the program.

6. We use `defer` to make sure we close the file when we're done, even if something goes wrong.

7. Now we create a special writer called a logger. This helps us write messages to the file in a structured way, including the time each message was written.

8. Finally, we use the logger to write our messages to the file.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. We import the packages we need.

2. In `main()`, we create the full path for our log file using `path.Join()` and `os.TempDir()`.

3. We print the log file path so the user knows where it is.

4. We try to open (or create) the file with `os.OpenFile()`. The flags we use tell Go to append to the file if it exists, create it if it doesn't, and open it for writing.

5. If there's an error opening the file, we print it and exit.

6. We use `defer` to close the file when the function ends.

7. We create a new logger with `log.New()`, giving it our file to write to.

8. We use the logger to write two messages to the file.

This code shows how to work with files, handle errors, and use the logging package in Go. It's a simple example of how programs can keep records of what they do.
