Imagine you have a secret club with a password. This code is like a digital bouncer for that club. It checks if someone knows the secret password ("admin" and "password") before letting them in. 

1. The Bouncer: The code creates a special bouncer called "badAuth". This bouncer knows the secret password and checks everyone who tries to enter.
2. The Door: The code sets up a door (called "/") that leads to a room where the club members can say hello.
3. The Guard Dog: The code hires a guard dog (called "negroni") to make sure the bouncer does their job properly. The guard dog also makes sure the door only opens for people with the right password.
4. The Club Opens: The code opens the club at a specific address (":8000") and waits for people to arrive.

How someone gets in:

1. Someone comes to the club's address (":8000") and knocks on the door ("/").
2. The guard dog wakes up the bouncer.
3. The bouncer asks for their username and password.
4. If they have the right password, the bouncer lets them through the door.
5. They enter the room and the club members greet them with a friendly "Hello!"

If someone doesn't know the password, the bouncer tells them they're not allowed in ("Unauthorized"). 

How to use
$curl -i http://localhost:8000/hello
// this gives you error 401 Unauthorized

$ curl -i 'http://localhost:8000/hello?username=admin&password=password'
// 200 OK hi admin
