Imagine a Special Mailbox:

1. The Mailbox: This code creates a special kind of mailbox on your computer.  Instead of letters, this mailbox receives messages from other computers.

2. The Mail Carrier (Epoll): There's a super-fast mail carrier named Epoll. Epoll's job is to watch the mailbox very closely and tell the computer as soon as a new message arrives. 

3. The Echo (Echo Function): Inside the mailbox, there's an echo machine. Whenever a message arrives, the echo machine reads it, shouts it back out loud (so the sender knows it was received), and then makes a copy of the message to keep.

4. Opening the Mailbox:
   - The computer sets up the mailbox to receive messages on a specific channel (like a radio station).
   - It tells the mail carrier (Epoll) to start watching the mailbox.

5. Receiving Messages:
    - When a message arrives, the mail carrier quickly alerts the computer.
    - The computer checks if the message is a new connection (like someone knocking on the door to say hello).
       - If it's a new connection, the computer says hello back and tells the mail carrier to also watch for messages from this new friend.
    - If it's a regular message, the computer sends it to the echo machine.

What's the Point?

This code is like a basic echo server. It's a simple way for computers to talk to each other. One computer sends a message, and the other computer echoes it back to confirm it was received.

Why Use Epoll?

Epoll is like having a really attentive mail carrier. It makes the mailbox super efficient. Instead of constantly checking for new mail, the computer can focus on other things until Epoll tells it there's a message. This is especially helpful when lots of computers want to send messages at the same time.
