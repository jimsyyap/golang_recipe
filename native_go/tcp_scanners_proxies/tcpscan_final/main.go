/*
* the program attempts to connect to scanme.nmap.org on each port from 1 to 1024
* it uses 100 concurrent worker goroutines to speed up the process
* if a connection is joy, the port number is considered open and added to the openports slice
* after all ports have been checked, it sorts the openports slice and prints the open ports
* the extra closing of channels and redundant printing at the end can be removed as they do not affect the outcome
