This Go code sets up a simple DNS server that forwards DNS requests to another DNS server. Here's an explanation of what each part does:

Import Statements

The `import` block imports necessary packages:
- `log`: For logging messages.
- `net`: For network operations.
- `network.dns/server/pkg/dns`: A custom package, presumably containing the DNS server logic.

DNSConfig Struct

The `DNSConfig` struct defines the configuration for the DNS server:
- `dnsForwarder`: The address of the DNS server to which requests will be forwarded (e.g., Google's public DNS server `8.8.8.8:53`).
- `port`: The port on which this DNS server will listen for incoming requests (default is 53, the standard DNS port).

main Function

The `main` function sets up and runs the DNS server:

1. Define Configuration:
   - Creates an instance of `DNSConfig` with the DNS forwarder set to `8.8.8.8:53` and the listening port set to 53.

2. Set Up UDP Connection for Incoming Requests:
   - `net.ListenUDP("udp", &net.UDPAddr{Port: dnsconfig.port})`: Listens for incoming UDP requests on the specified port (53). 
   - If there's an error opening this connection, the program panics (stops with an error message).
   - Ensures the connection is closed when the program ends with `defer conn.Close()`.

3. Set Up UDP Connection for Forwarding Requests:
   - `net.Dial("udp", dnsconfig.dnsForwarder)`: Creates a connection to the DNS forwarder (`8.8.8.8:53`).
   - If there's an error creating this connection, the program panics.
   - Ensures this connection is closed when the program ends with `defer dnsFwdConn.Close()`.

4. Create and Start DNS Server:
   - `dns.NewServer(conn, dns.NewUPResolver(dnsFwdConn))`: Creates a new DNS server instance.
     - `conn`: The connection for incoming DNS requests.
     - `dns.NewUPResolver(dnsFwdConn)`: A DNS resolver that forwards requests to the specified DNS forwarder.
   - Logs a message indicating the DNS server is starting on the specified port.
   - `dnsServer.Listen()`: Starts listening for incoming DNS requests.

Summary

- This code configures a DNS server that listens for DNS requests on port 53.
- It forwards these requests to Google's public DNS server (`8.8.8.8:53`).
- The server uses UDP for communication.
- The custom DNS server and resolver logic is presumably implemented in the `network.dns/server/pkg/dns` package.
