This Go code is about creating a simple web server that listens on port 8080 and responds to HTTP requests at the `/helloworld` endpoint with a JSON message. 

Package Declaration and Imports
```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)
```
- Package Declaration: The code is in the `main` package, which is the entry point for a Go application.
- Imports: It imports:
  - `encoding/json` for JSON encoding.
  - `fmt` for formatting strings.
  - `log` for logging messages.
  - `net/http` for handling HTTP requests and responses.

Data Structure
```go
type helloWorldResponse struct {
	Message string `json:"message"`
}
```
- helloWorldResponse: This struct represents the JSON response structure. It has a single field `Message` which will be converted to JSON with the key `message`.

Main Function
```go
func main() {
	port := 8080

	http.HandleFunc("/helloworld", helloWorldHandler)

	log.Printf("server on port %v\n", port)
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%v", port), nil))
}
```
- port Variable: Defines the port number (8080) on which the server will listen.
- http.HandleFunc: Registers the `helloWorldHandler` function to handle requests to the `/helloworld` URL path.
- log.Printf: Logs a message indicating the server is starting and which port it will use.
- log.Fatal: Starts the HTTP server on the specified port. If the server fails to start, it logs the error and exits.

Handler Function
```go
func helloWorldHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	response := helloWorldResponse{Message: "HelloWorld"}
	data, err := json.Marshal(response)
	if err != nil {
		panic("Ooops")
	}

	fmt.Fprint(w, string(data))
}
```
- helloWorldHandler: This function handles HTTP requests to the `/helloworld` URL path.
  - response: Creates an instance of `helloWorldResponse` with the message "HelloWorld".
  - json.Marshal: Converts the `response` struct to JSON format.
  - Error Handling: If JSON marshalling fails, it panics with the message "Ooops".
  - fmt.Fprint: Writes the JSON response as a string to the HTTP response writer `w`.

Step-by-Step Execution
1. Define Port: The server will listen on port 8080.
2. Register Handler: The `helloWorldHandler` function is registered to handle requests to the `/helloworld` URL path.
3. Log Server Start: Logs a message indicating that the server is starting and which port it will use.
4. Start Server: The server starts listening on port 8080. If any errors occur, they are logged, and the program exits.
5. Handle Requests: When a request is made to `/helloworld`, the `helloWorldHandler` function creates a JSON response with the message "HelloWorld" and sends it back to the client.

Purpose
The purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to set up a simple HTTP server in Go that responds with a JSON message when a specific endpoint (`/helloworld`) is accessed. This involves defining a response structure, registering a handler function, and starting the server.
