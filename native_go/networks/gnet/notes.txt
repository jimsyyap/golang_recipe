This code creates a simple TCP echo server using the `gnet` library. An echo server sends back (or "echoes") the data it receives from clients.

Package and Imports

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/panjf2000/gnet"
)
```

1. package main: This defines the package name. `main` is a special package in Go which tells the compiler that this package will produce an executable program.
2. import: This is used to include libraries.
   - `fmt`: For formatted I/O operations.
   - `log`: For logging information.
   - `github.com/panjf2000/gnet`: The `gnet` library is used for building high-performance network servers.

Defining the Echo Server
```go
type echoServer struct {
	*gnet.EventServer
}
```

- type echoServer struct {...}: This defines a new type `echoServer` which embeds `*gnet.EventServer`. Embedding `*gnet.EventServer` means that `echoServer` inherits methods from `gnet.EventServer`, and can override them if needed.

React Method
```go
func (es *echoServer) React(frame []byte, c gnet.Conn) (out []byte, action gnet.Action) {
	out = ([]byte)("return - " + string(frame))
	fmt.Println("Reacting....")
	return
}
```

1. func (es *echoServer) React(...): This method is called whenever the server receives data from a client.
   - `frame []byte`: The data received from the client.
   - `c gnet.Conn`: The connection from which the data was received.
   - `out []byte`: The data to be sent back to the client.
   - `action gnet.Action`: An action indicating what the server should do next (e.g., `None`, `Close`, `Shutdown`).
2. out = ([]byte)("return - " + string(frame)): This constructs the response by converting the received data to a string, prefixing it with "return - ", and converting it back to a byte slice.
3. fmt.Println("Reacting...."): This prints "Reacting...." to the console each time the server reacts to a message.
4. return: This returns the response and the action.

Main Function
```go
func main() {
	echo := new(echoServer)
	log.Fatal(gnet.Serve(echo, "tcp://:9001", gnet.WithMulticore(true)))
}
```

1. echo := new(echoServer): This creates a new instance of `echoServer`.
2. log.Fatal(gnet.Serve(echo, "tcp://:9001", gnet.WithMulticore(true))):
   - gnet.Serve(echo, "tcp://:9001", gnet.WithMulticore(true)): This starts the server, telling it to listen for TCP connections on port 9001.
     - `echo`: The server instance to use.
     - `"tcp://:9001"`: The address and port to listen on.
     - `gnet.WithMulticore(true)`: This option enables multicore support, allowing the server to use multiple CPU cores for handling connections.
   - log.Fatal(...): If `gnet.Serve` returns an error, `log.Fatal` will log the error and terminate the program.

Summary

1. The program defines an echo server that listens on port 9001.
2. When the server receives data, it responds with "return - " followed by the received data.
3. The server uses the `gnet` library, which is designed for high-performance network applications.
4. The server runs in multicore mode, utilizing multiple CPU cores to handle incoming connections efficiently.

This code creates a simple, efficient echo server capable of handling multiple clients concurrently, thanks to the power of the `gnet` library and Go's concurrency features.
