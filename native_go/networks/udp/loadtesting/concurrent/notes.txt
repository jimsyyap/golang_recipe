This code sets up a UDP server that listens on port 3333 and uses multiple goroutines to handle incoming UDP packets. It simulates processing each request for 10 milliseconds before responding.

Package and Imports
```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net"
	"runtime"
	"time"
)
```

1. package main: This defines the package name. `main` is a special package in Go which tells the compiler that this package will produce an executable program.
2. import: This is used to include libraries.
   - `log`: For logging information.
   - `net`: For networking, to handle UDP connections.
   - `runtime`: For interacting with the Go runtime, particularly to get the number of available CPU cores.
   - `time`: For handling time-related operations like sleeping.

listen Function
```go
func listen(i int, connection *net.UDPConn, quit chan struct{}) {
	buffer := make([]byte, 512)
	for {
		_, remote, err := connection.ReadFromUDP(buffer)
		if err != nil {
			break
		}

		//pretend the code is doing some request processing for 10 milliseconds
		time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
		connection.WriteToUDP([]byte("\n"), remote)
	}
	quit <- struct{}{}
}
```

1. func listen(i int, connection *net.UDPConn, quit chan struct{}): This is a function that runs in a goroutine to handle incoming UDP packets.
   - `i`: An integer to identify the goroutine.
   - `connection`: A pointer to the UDP connection.
   - `quit`: A channel to signal when the goroutine should stop.
2. buffer := make([]byte, 512): Creates a buffer of 512 bytes to store incoming data.
3. for {...}: An infinite loop that continually reads from the UDP connection.
4. _, remote, err := connection.ReadFromUDP(buffer): Reads data from the UDP connection into the buffer.
   - `remote`: The address of the remote client.
   - `err`: Error if any occurred while reading.
5. if err != nil {...}: If there is an error reading from the connection, break the loop.
6. time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond): Simulates processing the request for 10 milliseconds.
7. connection.WriteToUDP([]byte("\n"), remote): Sends a newline character back to the client.
8. quit <- struct{}{}: Sends an empty struct to the quit channel, signaling that this goroutine has finished.

Main Function
```go
func main() {
	addr := net.UDPAddr{
		Port: 3333,
	}
	connection, err := net.ListenUDP("udp", &addr)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	quit := make(chan struct{})
	for i := 0; i < runtime.NumCPU(); i++ {
		log.Println("Spinning up UDP server - ", i)
		id := i
		go listen(id, connection, quit)
	}
	<-quit
}
```

1. func main(): The main entry point of the program.
2. addr := net.UDPAddr{Port: 3333}: Defines the address to listen on, which is port 3333.
3. connection, err := net.ListenUDP("udp", &addr): Starts listening for UDP connections on the specified address.
   - `connection`: A pointer to the UDP connection.
   - `err`: Error if any occurred while starting the listener.
4. if err != nil {...}: If there is an error, panic and stop the program.
5. quit := make(chan struct{}): Creates a channel to signal when a goroutine should stop.
6. for i := 0; i < runtime.NumCPU(); i++ {...}: Loops over the number of CPU cores, starting a goroutine for each core.
   - `runtime.NumCPU()`: Returns the number of CPU cores available.
7. log.Println("Spinning up UDP server - ", i): Logs the creation of a new server goroutine.
8. id := i: Stores the current loop index in `id` to avoid issues with the loop variable being shared by all goroutines.
9. go listen(id, connection, quit): Starts a new goroutine to handle incoming UDP packets.
10. <-quit: Waits for a message on the `quit` channel, which will be sent when one of the goroutines finishes.

Summary

- Multi-core UDP Server: This code sets up a UDP server that listens on port 3333 and handles incoming packets using multiple goroutines, one for each CPU core.
- Concurrent Handling: Each goroutine runs the `listen` function, which reads data from the UDP connection, simulates processing the request for 10 milliseconds, and sends a response back.
- Synchronization: The `quit` channel is used to signal when a goroutine has finished, causing the main function to exit once any goroutine stops.
