This code sets up a simple UDP server that listens on port 3000, receives messages from clients, logs the received messages, and then responds to the clients with a newline character.

Main Function

```go
func main() {
	conn, err := net.ListenUDP("udp", &net.UDPAddr{
		Port: 3000,
		IP:   net.ParseIP("0.0.0.0"),
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	defer conn.Close()
	log.Printf("Listening %s\n", conn.LocalAddr().String())
```

1. func main(): The main entry point of the program.
2. conn, err := net.ListenUDP("udp", &net.UDPAddr{...}): Starts listening for UDP connections on port 3000 and binds to all available IP addresses (`0.0.0.0`).
   - `conn`: A pointer to the UDP connection.
   - `err`: Error if any occurred while starting the listener.
   - `net.UDPAddr{Port: 3000, IP: net.ParseIP("0.0.0.0")}`: Defines the address to listen on, with port 3000 and IP address `0.0.0.0`.

3. if err != nil {...}: If there is an error, panic and stop the program using `panic(err)`.
4. defer conn.Close(): Ensures that the connection is closed when the main function exits.
5. log.Printf("Listening %s\n", conn.LocalAddr().String()): Logs the address the server is listening on.

UDP Message Handling

```go
	for {
		message := make([]byte, 512)
		_, remoteAddr, err := conn.ReadFromUDP(message[:])
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}

		data := strings.TrimSpace(string(message))
		log.Printf("Received: %s from %s\n", data, remoteAddr)
		conn.WriteToUDP([]byte("\n"), remoteAddr)
	}
}
```

1. for {...}: An infinite loop that continually reads from the UDP connection.
2. message := make([]byte, 512): Creates a buffer of 512 bytes to store incoming data.
3. _, remoteAddr, err := conn.ReadFromUDP(message[:]): Reads data from the UDP connection into the buffer.
   - `remoteAddr`: The address of the remote client.
   - `err`: Error if any occurred while reading.
4. if err != nil {...}: If there is an error reading from the connection, panic and stop the program using `panic(err)`.
5. data := strings.TrimSpace(string(message)): Converts the byte slice `message` to a string and trims any leading or trailing whitespace.
6. log.Printf("Received: %s from %s\n", data, remoteAddr): Logs the received message and the address of the remote client.
7. conn.WriteToUDP([]byte("\n"), remoteAddr): Sends a newline character back to the client.

Summary

- UDP Server Setup: The program sets up a UDP server that listens on port 3000, binding to all available IP addresses (`0.0.0.0`).
- Message Handling: The server reads incoming UDP messages into a 512-byte buffer.
- String Processing: The server converts the byte slice to a string and trims any leading or trailing whitespace using `strings.TrimSpace`.
- Logging: The server logs the received message and the address of the remote client.
- Response: After logging, the server responds to the client by sending a newline character.
- Error Handling: The server uses `panic` to handle any errors that occur while reading messages. This is generally not recommended for production code but can be useful for simple scripts or debugging.

This program continuously listens for incoming UDP messages, processes each message by logging it, and sends a response back to the client. The use of `defer` ensures that the connection is properly closed when the program terminates.
