What it Does:

This code is like a painter giving your words different colors and styles when they appear in your computer's terminal (that black window where you type commands).

How it Works:

1. Color Toolbox: Imagine a big box of crayons. This code uses a special tool called "color" (think of it as the box) that has lots of crayons inside for making your words colorful.

2. Setting the Mood:
   - It picks two special crayons for warnings ("Warn") and errors ("Error").
   - For warnings, it uses a white crayon on a regular background.
   - For errors, it uses a red crayon on a regular background.

3. Styling Your Words:
   -  Italic:  It writes the words "Italing style" leaning sideways (like *this*).
   -  Strikethrough:  It writes the words "Strikethrough style" with a line through the middle (~like this~).
   -  Bold:  It writes the words "Bold style" in extra dark letters (like  this ).

4.  Special Messages: 
   -  Warning Message:  It writes "Warning message" in the special white color it picked earlier, maybe with a symbol next to it (like a yellow triangle).
   -  Error Message:  It writes "Error message" in bright red, maybe with a different symbol (like a red X).

 Why This is Useful: 

-  Clear Messages:  By using different colors and styles, this code makes it easier to spot important messages in your terminal. Warnings stand out in white, and errors scream in red.
-  Customizable:  You can easily change the colors and styles to match your preferences, just like picking different crayons from the box.
