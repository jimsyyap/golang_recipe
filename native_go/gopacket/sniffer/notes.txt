Imagine a Special Camera for Internet Messages

1. Setting Up the Camera (main):
   - The code starts by getting a special camera ready. This camera isn't for taking pictures of people, but for recording secret messages that travel between computers on the internet.
   - It also opens a notebook (a file named `test.pcap`) where it will write down everything the camera sees.

2. Pointing the Camera (pcap.OpenLive):
   - The camera is pointed at a specific cable (like a wire connecting your computer to the internet) called "enp0s31f6". This cable carries lots of messages.

3. Watching and Recording (for packet := range pSource.Packets()):
   - The camera starts recording. Every time a message passes by, it takes a snapshot of the message.
   - It only records 1,000 snapshots, so it doesn't fill up the notebook too quickly.

4. Examining the Snapshots (printPacketInfo):
   - The code looks at each snapshot and figures out what kind of message it is. 
   - It checks if the message is about finding websites (DNS), sending information quickly (UDP), having a reliable conversation (TCP), or if it's part of a website you can see in your browser (HTTP).
   - If it finds anything interesting in the message, like the website addresses or the contents of a web page, it writes it down in the notebook.

In simple words, this code:
- Sets up a tool to watch the messages your computer sends and receives on the internet.
- Takes snapshots of these messages and saves them in a special file.
- Looks through the snapshots to see what kind of messages they are and what information they contain.
- Writes down any interesting information in a notebook.

Important Note:
- Running this code requires specific permissions on your computer, as it needs access to your network interface to capture the data.
