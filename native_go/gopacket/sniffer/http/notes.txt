Imagine this code is like a detective's toolkit for the internet:

1. The Detective's Gear:
   - `gopacket`: Imagine a set of magnifying glasses to look closely at the tiny pieces (packets) of information that travel around the internet.
   - `tcpassembly`: A big puzzle board where the detective puts the pieces together to understand conversations between computers.
   - `net/http`: A special book that helps the detective understand a specific kind of internet talk called HTTP (like when you ask a website for a picture).

2. The Detective's Mission:
   - To capture secret messages hidden inside the internet chatter between computers. These messages are often about what websites people visit or what they do on those websites.

3. How the Detective Works:
   - Grabbing the Clues: The code uses tools to "listen in" on the conversations happening over a specific internet cable (like tapping a phone line).
   - Picking Out the Interesting Bits:  It filters out the boring parts and focuses only on the conversations that seem important (like when websites send pictures or videos).
   - Assembling the Puzzle: It carefully puts the pieces of each conversation in order on the puzzle board (`tcpassembly`).
   - Reading the Secret Messages: Using the special book (`net/http`), it decodes the messages and figures out what the computers were talking about.
   - Taking Notes: It writes down interesting things it finds, like what website was visited or what file was downloaded.

What Could the Detective Use This For?

- Finding Bad Guys:  The detective could use this to catch people doing sneaky things online (like stealing information).
- Fixing Website Problems: It can help figure out why a website isn't working properly (maybe someone is messing with the conversation).
- Understanding How People Use the Internet: This could help make websites better or create new, cool internet stuff.

Important Note: This is a simplified version. The actual code is more complex, but this explanation gives you the main idea of what it's trying to do.
