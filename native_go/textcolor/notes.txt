What it Does:

This code is like a set of special markers for different types of messages. Imagine you have a box of crayons with different colors for different things: green for good news, yellow for a heads-up, red for problems, and blue for secret messages. This code does something similar, but for messages on your computer screen.

How it Works:

1. Special Codes:  The code starts by defining special codes for each type of message:
   - `Info`:  This code makes messages appear in green (like green crayons).
   - `Warn`: This code makes messages appear in yellow.
   - `Error`: This code makes messages appear in red.
   - `Debug`: This code makes messages appear in blue.

2. Printing Messages:
   - The `fmt.Println` lines are like writing messages with your different crayons.
   - Each message starts with the special code (like picking a crayon).
   - Then, it writes the actual message after the code (like writing with the chosen crayon).

Example:

When you run this code, you'll see something like this:

```
[INFO] This is an info message
[WARN] This is a warning message
[ERROR] This is an error message
[DEBUG] This is a debug message
```

Notice how each message has a colored label in front? That's the result of the special codes!

Why This is Useful:

- Clear Messages: By using different colors, this code makes it easier to tell the difference between different types of messages. You can quickly spot errors (red) or warnings (yellow).
- Organized Information: This kind of labeling is helpful for keeping track of what's happening in a computer program. It's like having different colored folders for different kinds of information.
