this chapter focuses on the client side. It will first introduce you to the basics of building and customizing http requests and receiving their responses. Then you'll learn how to parse structured response data so the client can interrogate the information to determine actionable or relevant data.

Finally, you'll learn how to apply these fundamentals by building http clients that interact with a variety of security tools and resources.

The clients you develop will query and consume the APIs of shodan, bing, and metasploit and will search and parse document metadata in a manner similar to the metadata serch tool FOCA.
