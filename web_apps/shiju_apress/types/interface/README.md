Imagine you're creating a computer game about a team of superheroes. This code is like the blueprint for that game. Let's break it down:

1. The User Interface:
   Think of this as a list of superpowers that all heroes must have. In this case, every hero must be able to:
   - Say their name (PrintName)
   - Share their details (PrintDetails)

2. The Person struct:
   This is like the basic template for creating a character. It includes things every person has:
   - First name and last name
   - Date of birth
   - Email and location

3. Admin and Member structs:
   These are special types of characters. They're built using the Person template (that's what we call composition - they're composed of a Person), but they have extra features:
   - An Admin has special roles
   - A Member has special skills

4. Method Overriding:
   This is like giving these special characters their own unique way of sharing details. When you ask them to PrintDetails, they'll do it their own way, showing off their roles or skills.

5. The Team struct:
   This is like creating a superhero team. It has a name, description, and a list of Users (remember, both Admin and Member are types of Users).

Now, let's think about how you might write this code:

1. Start with the basics:
   - What does every character need to be able to do? (That's your User interface)
   - What information does every character need? (That's your Person struct)

2. Think about special types of characters:
   - What makes an Admin special? They have roles.
   - What makes a Member special? They have skills.

3. Give these special characters their own way of sharing details:
   - An Admin will share their Person details and then list their roles.
   - A Member will share their Person details and then list their skills.

4. Create a way to make a team:
   - What does a team need? A name, description, and a list of members.
   - How does the team share its information? By going through each member and asking them to share their details.

5. Finally, in the main function, you're creating some example characters and a team, then asking the team to share its details.

The clever part of this code is that it uses interfaces and composition to create a flexible system. You could easily add new types of Users (like a SuperAdmin or a GuestMember) without changing how the Team works. The Team doesn't care what type of User it has - it just knows that all Users can PrintName and PrintDetails.

This approach helps you create code that's easy to expand and change later, just like how in a real superhero team, you might want to add new heroes with different powers without changing how the whole team works together.
